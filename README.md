# CS50-AI-Course

Over the quarantine break, I spent my time learning AI fundamentals at Harvard University's CS50 course on EdX. I created over 12 projects, including a tic tac toe AI, a minesweeper AI, a crossword puzzle solver, and an image classifier. I applied key course concepts such as search algorithms, probability analysis, and optimization, as well as technologies/libraries such as TensorFlow, NLTK, OpenCV, Sci-Kit Learn and Numpy.
